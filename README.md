# Architect-API-integration-in-Azure
Learn how to architect API integration in Azure, and provide secure, scalable API access for your applications. In this meetup, we will create an API gateway to achieve the following: - Securely publish an API. - Use policies to enable caching in order to improve API performance under load. - Remove response headers, replace URLs, and throttle requests to achieve a secure endpoint for clients to communicate with. - Ensure that only people with the right credentials can access the information in your API. - Use API Management to assemble multiple microservices, implemented as Azure Functions, into an integrated web API.
